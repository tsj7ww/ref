# FILE SPACING:
 # double space a file
 awk '1;{print ""}'
 awk 'BEGIN{ORS="\n\n"};1'
 # double space a file which already has blank lines in it. Output file
 # should contain no more than one blank line between lines of text.
 # NOTE: On Unix systems, DOS lines which have only CRLF (\r\n) are
 # often treated as non-blank, and thus 'NF' alone will return TRUE.
 awk 'NF{print $0 "\n"}'
 # triple space a file
 awk '1;{print "\n"}'
# NUMBERING AND CALCULATIONS:
 # precede each line by its line number FOR THAT FILE (left alignment).
 # Using a tab (\t) instead of space will preserve margins.
 awk '{print FNR "\t" $0}' files*
 # precede each line by its line number FOR ALL FILES TOGETHER, with tab.

 # number each line of a file (number on left, right-aligned)
 # Double the percent signs if typing from the DOS command prompt.

 # Remember caveats about Unix treatment of \r (mentioned above)

 # Example: insert 49 spaces after column #6 of each input line.

# ARRAY CREATION:
 # These next 2 entries are not one-line scripts, but the technique
 # is so handy that it merits inclusion here.
 # create an array named "month", indexed by numbers, so that month[1]
 # is 'Jan', month[2] is 'Feb', month[3] is 'Mar' and so on.
